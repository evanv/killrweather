/**
 * The `NodeGuardian` is the root of the primary KillrWeather deployed application.
 * It manages the worker actors and is Akka Cluster aware by extending [[ClusterAware]].
 *
 * Creates the [[KafkaStreamingActor]] which
 *    - Transforms raw weather data .gz files
 *    to line data and publishes to the Kafka topic created in [[KillrWeatherApp]].
 *    - Creates a streaming pipeline from Kafka to Cassandra,
 *    via Spark, which streams the raw data from Kafka, transforms each line of data to
 *    a [[com.datastax.killrweather.Weather.RawWeatherData]] (hourly per weather station),
 *    and saves the new data to the cassandra raw data table as it arrives.
 *
 * NOTE: if `NodeGuardian` is ever put on an Akka router, multiple instances of the stream will
 * exist on the node. Might want to call 'union' on the streams in that case.
